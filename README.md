This is about ChatGPT and video editing.

It’s an editing bot that, given a text input, will edit a video: it selects the best video clips according to ChatGPT and generates the voiceover. You can choose either portrait or landscape format, making it suitable for backgrounds in videos or TikTok-style content. The voice is currently robotic, but I plan to improve it using another API.

You’ll need to set up a Google API and OpenAI API, both of which are free.

Feel free to contact me to discuss feature updates!
